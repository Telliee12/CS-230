Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming room is looking to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game Draw it or Lose It. This game is currently only available on Android, but they are looking to expand so that it can become accessible to everyone. To win the game your team must guess the puzzle within a minute before their time expires. If they fail to do so, the other team then gets one chance to guess within 15 seconds to win the round. The team with the most won round will win the game.
  As discussed, the following requirements have been asking for the gaming room application. 
    •	We should establish a game system that will allow one or more teams to participate. 
    •	Establish a system where teams will allow multiple players to be assigned to it. 
    •	Establish a database that will restrict game and team names to be unique. 
    •	Create another database where unique identifiers for each instance for game, team and player are recorded. 


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

While developing this document I feel I did particularly well in my explanations of the Executive summary, Design constraints and the Domain model. I made sure I provided as much detail as possible to the client so that would have a full understating of what was going on. 


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

When developing code, I was able to look back at my design document for any information I needed, and I found that very helpful. Instead of having to send out emails or ask people questions, I was able to open my design document and answer my own questions. I frequently referred to the Domain Model section because it helped me keep my code clean and organized. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my document to revise, I would choose the evaluation. I feel I did well on the Mac, Linux, and windows portion, but I could have gone more in depth on the mobile device’s aspect. Although I would still choose to not go that route after doing some research, I realize that there are platforms that allow you to host on mobile devices.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is always important to consider the users needs when designing because they are the people who will be using the product. If they don’t like the final product then all the time and money spent on developing would have been a waste. You can interpret the user needs by asking them questions or asking them to file out documentation that gives you knowledge on exactly what they are looking for. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When designing software, I like to overview the bigger picture and then break it down into smaller parts. This allows me to better understand each aspect of the project one at a time. I first like to brainstorm and plan and then look over the requirements that were given to me by the client. I can then break into the design and development phases down the line.
